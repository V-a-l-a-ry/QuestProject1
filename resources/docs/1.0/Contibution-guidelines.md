## Contribution Guidelines
### Version Control

 Using Git and GitHub
To maintain a clean and organized codebase, it’s essential to follow specific version control practices. Here’s how to contribute using Git and GitHub:

 Fork the Repository

Before making any changes, fork the main repository on GitHub. This creates a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.
Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

 Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your feature, bug fix, or improvement. Name the branch according to the feature or issue you're working on. For example:
git checkout -b feature/new-user-profile
Use descriptive names that reflect the task you’re addressing.

 Commit Your Changes

Make your changes in the new branch. Follow these guidelines for commits:
Write clear, concise commit messages that explain what you changed and why.
Commit related changes together; avoid large commits with multiple unrelated changes.
Example:
git add .
git commit -m "Add user profile view and update functionality"

 Push Your Branch

Push your branch to your forked repository:
git push origin feature/new-user-profile

 Create a Pull Request

Go to the original repository on GitHub and create a pull request (PR) from your branch.
In the PR description, provide a summary of what your changes do and why they are necessary. Reference any related issue numbers.
Request a review from the maintainers or team members.

 Address Feedback

Be prepared to make revisions based on feedback from code reviews. Push any changes to the same branch, and they will automatically be included in the pull request.

#### Branching Strategy
To keep the repository clean and maintainable, follow this branching strategy:

main branch: The main branch is always stable and contains the latest production-ready code. Only merge fully tested features or bug fixes here.
develop branch: This branch is used for integrating features before they are merged into the main branch. All feature branches should branch off from develop.
Feature branches: Branches for new features or enhancements. Name them according to the feature being implemented, such as feature/new-login-ui.
Bugfix branches: Branches for fixing bugs. Name them like bugfix/fix-login-error.

 Merge Strategy
Squash and Merge to keep the commit history clean. This combines all commits in a feature branch into a single commit when merging into the main branch.
Always make sure your branch is up to date with the main or develop branch before merging.

git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout feature/new-feature
git merge develop'

###  Issue Tracking

 Reporting Bugs
Go to the repository's Issues tab on GitHub.
Click on New Issue and select Bug Report.
Fill out the issue template, providing detailed information:
Title: A clear and descriptive title.
Description: Steps to reproduce the bug, expected vs. actual behavior, and screenshots if applicable.
Environment: Specify the environment (e.g., OS, browser, version) where the bug occurred.

 Requesting Features
In the Issues tab, click New Issue and select Feature Request.
Describe the feature you would like to see, including:
Title: A short, descriptive title.
Description: A detailed explanation of the feature, why it is needed, and how it might work.
Mockups or Examples: Provide any sketches, mockups, or examples that help convey your idea.

 Tracking Progress
Labels: labels to categorize issues and pull requests (e.g., bug, enhancement, help wanted).
Milestones: Group related issues and PRs under milestones to track progress toward a specific goal or release.
Assignees: Assigning issues to indicate who is working on them.
Projects:GitHub Projects to organize issues and PRs into a visual board, tracking their progress from To Do to In Progress to Done.
